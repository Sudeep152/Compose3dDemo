# Compose3dDemo

## Overview
Compose3dDemo is an Android project that demonstrates the integration of 3D models within a Jetpack Compose environment using the SceneView library. The project provides an interactive 3D experience where users can view, scale, and interact with models stored locally in the appâ€™s asset folder. This project highlights the potential of 3D model rendering in mobile apps with Compose.

## Features
- **Custom 3D Model Display**: Loads `.glb` models from the local assets folder for offline 3D rendering.
- **Interactive Model Control**: Users can interact with the model through gestures for scaling, ensuring a centered view even as the model is manipulated.
- **Configurable Scene**: Adjustable parameters for camera position, model scale, background color, and environment background.
- **Composable Design**: Built entirely within Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative UI experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Jetpack Compose**: For a declarative UI.
- **SceneView**: To render and interact with 3D models.
- **Kotlin**: Primary language for development.
